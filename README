This module provides a Twisted reactor for kqueue that works on FreeBSD,
has no external dependencies, but relies on the built-in kqueue support
of Python in the select module since Python 2.6.

Usage:

from txkqreactor import kqreactor
kqreactor.install()

from twisted.internet import reactor

print "Using Twisted reactor class", reactor.__class__
